1. Introduction
**********************************************

The SDK provides information and examples for the scripting interface to Adobe 
Lightroom. The SDK defines a scripting interface for the Lua language.

A number of new namespaces have been added in the 6.0 SDK release. Please see the API
Reference for more information about each of the new namespaces:

1.	LrSocket: provides ability to send and receive data from other processes
	using sockets.
2.	LrApplicationView: provides access to the application's view state including 
	module, main view, secondary view, and zoom control. 
3.	LrDevelopController: provides access to controls in the Develop module.
4.	LrSelection: provides access to selection based commands including flags,
	color labels, ratings, and active image selection. 
5.	LrSlideshow: allows starting and stopping a slideshow.
6.	LrTether: gives control over tethered shooting.
7.	LrUndo: provides access to undo/redo commands.
8.	LrSounds: allows playing system sounds.


Key Bug Fixes:

1. 	catalog:createVirtualCopies(...) will now create the proper number of virutal copies
	when multiple photos are selected in library loupe or develop.
2.	LrKeyword:getAttributes() will now indicate if the keyword is a face tag.
3.	LrDialogs.runSavePanel(...) prompt parameter will now work correctly on Windows.
4.	"Direction" Exif metadata can now be accessed via LrPhoto.get/setRawMetadata(...)
5.	LrApplication.purchaseSource() and LrApplication.serialNumberHas() will behave more
	consistently with CC versions of Lr.
6.	catalog:batchGetFormattedMetadata(...) will now correctly return "maxAvailWidth" and
	"maxAvailHeight"
7.	viewFactory:scrolled_view(...) visible property can now be bound on mac.
8.	Docs have been updated to correct a number of issues.
